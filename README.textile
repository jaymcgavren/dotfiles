h1. Jay's Dotfiles

This is my collection of Unix/Linux shell scripts and configuration files. I'm releasing them here in hopes of helping others, and in hopes of learning from others in turn.


h1. Installation

Most users will want to simply borrow the snippets they find interesting or useful. But if you want to use the entire environment as is, you can do so by sourcing it from your own shell configuration...

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/jaymcgavren/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
~/dotfiles/bootstrap/link_dotfiles.sh
</pre>

This will copy the repo into your home directory and create symlinks so the repo contents are used in place of your config files. You may need to move the original config files out of the way first. (Keep backups!)

The `zshrc` file, in particular, should add all the scripts to your $PATH and do other environment setup when a new shell loads.


h1. Directories

* /
** "bash_profile" is equivalent to ~/.bash_profile, "irbrc" to "~/.irbrc", etc.
* bin/
** Contains scripts suitable for use in the bash shell on any Unix-like system.
* bin/osx/
** These scripts are specific to Mac OS X.
