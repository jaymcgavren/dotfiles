# cd_size, maxfile_size, and first_disc altered by Jay McGavren, 2010-02-20.

# See http://danborn.net/multicd/ for documentation, information
# about usage, and how to configure multicd on your system.

# This is a sample configuration file for my multicd program.  Everything that
# is configurable about my program is listed here.  You'll want to make sure
# you change these to useful values for your system.

# All file paths must be absolute.  No relative path names.
# If a line contains a "#", everything after that is a comment.

# Options in the global config file are overridden by options in a user's
# config file, which can both be overridden by command line options.

# Command line options have the same name as their name in here.  Boolean
# options don't need a value on the command line.  For booleans, if the option
# appears, true (or enabled) is assumed.
# Examples:
# multicd --files /home /etc /usr/local --exclude /home/httpd --only_one
# multicd --files / --exclude /tmp /dev /proc --multi

# NOTE: If you are a user of a previous version of multicd, it is important
# to note that the use of image_dir is no longer supported.  Image file
# locations are now specified by giving the full path to the name of the
# image file by using image_file1 and image_file2.

# Turns on multithreadedness.  This will cause the files for the next CD image
# to be copied while the current one is still burning.  0 to disable this, 1
# to enable it.
multi = 0

# If this is enabled, then multicd will run in a non-interactive mode.  It
# will fit all of the files it can onto a single CD image, assume that a
# disc is in the writer, burn the CD, and then quit.  1 to enable this, 0
# to disable it.  You can assume that enabling this disables any
# multithreading.
only_one = 0

# Tell multicd where to put and what to name the image file.  After a CD
# has been burned from a given image file, a new file system is created on the
# image file and it is reused for the next set of data.  This is much better
# than deleting the old image file and creating a new one, because creating
# image files usually takes a long time.
# Required field.
image_file1 = /var/tmp/multicd_image1

# If multi is enabled, a second image file is required.
image_file2 = /var/tmp/multicd_image2

# The mount point for the image file while files are being copied to it.
# Required field.
image_mount = /var/tmp/multicd_image_mount

# The size of the image file to create.  Can be specified in terms of
# megabytes, kilobytes, or bytes.
# Examples:
# 4G          # Use a "G" for gigabytes.
# 650M        # Use an "M" for megabytes.
# 665600K     # Use a "K" for kilobytes.
# 681574400   # Don't use any letter for bytes.
# Required field.
cd_size = 8G

# Files larger than this will not be copied to the CD.  This value needs
# to be smaller than cd_size, but exactly how much smaller depends on
# the filesystem type used on the CD.  Rather than trying to guess this
# myself, or put an arbitrary number in the code, I'm leaving it up to
# the user.  620M/650M should be pretty safe, but maybe too
# conservative.
maxfile_size = 4G

# Type of file system to create on the backup CDs.  This will probably
# be expanded to include other filesystem types in the future.
# Required field.
fs_type = ext2

# Extra options to give to mkfs.  The options shown here apply to
# the default filesystem type of ext2 shown above.  -m 0 means
# reserve 0 space for root, -q means quiet, and -F forces file
# system creation on an image file.
# If you wish to use multicd to burn DVDs, try:
#   mkfs_opts = -m 0 -q -F -b 2048
mkfs_opts = -m 0 -q -F

# List of files to backup.
# Example: files = /home /etc /usr/local "/home/joe smith"
# Note: In the config file, you may use double quotes with the files and
# exclude options for files that contain spaces.
# Use a dash to indicate that a list of files, one per line, should be
# read from stdin.
files = /

# Alternative to "files" option.  Specify a text file with files listed one
# per line.
# One of either files_list or files is required.
#files_list = /tmp/myfiles.txt

# This sets the type of compression to use, if any.  Each file in the
# backup set will be compressed and renamed to end in either .gz,
# .bz2, or .z, depending on the type of compression.  Set to 0 for no
# compression, 1 for gzip, 2 for bzip2, and 3 for compress.
compress = 0

# Set the compression level.  The gzip program defaults to 6, bzip2
# defaults to 9, and compress doesn't support levels.  See the man
# pages for gzip and bzip2 for details.  Leave this option blank to
# use the default.
compress_level = 6

# List of files to exclude from the list given for files above.
exclude = /dev /lost+found /mnt /proc /tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp

# Alternative to "exclude" option.  Speciify a text file with files listed
# one per line.
#exclude_list = /tmp/excludes.txt

# This is how cdrecord should be run.  multicd will append the name of
# the image file to burn to the end.  Any output cdrecord produces is
# sent to STDERR.
# Required field.
cdrecord = cdrecord -v blank=fast speed=4 dev=0,0,0 -data

# You can use this to specify a command to run after each CD is done
# burning.
# The example shown simply opens the CD tray, but you could configure
# it to run a command that plays a sound, or both ejects and plays a sound,
# like this: cd_done = eject /dev/cdrom; cat cdsound.wav > /dev/dsp
# cd_done = cdrecord dev=0,0,0 -eject
cd_done = eject /dev/cdrom 

# Yet another mode of operation.  If enabled, then multicd will create as
# many image files as it needs to backup all of your files.  It won't burn
# any CDs, just create a bunch of image files.  For the image file names it
# will use the image_file1 value followed by the CD number.
# 1 to enable, 0 to disable.
noburn = 0

# Another way to speed things along.  If this is enabled, then it is
# assumed that the first disc for burning is already in the drive.  The
# first CD will be burned automatically without prompting the user to put a
# disc in, but all discs after the first will be prompted for.
first_disc = 1

# multicd normally starts out with blank CDs before it begins copying
# files.  With this option enabled, multicd will save a copy of all the
# files on the current CD, and add the new ones to it.  1 to enable, 0 to
# disable.
addfiles = 0

# If specified, only backup files that have been modified since the
# time specified.  Use d, h, m, and s to give units in days, hours,
# minutes, and seconds.
#since = 2d 4h 3m 18s

# If addfiles is enabled, then the rewriteable CD will need to be mounted
# and have files copied from it.  cd_dev and cd_mount are needed only when
# addfiles is enabled.  cd_dev is the device file for you cd burner.
cd_dev = /dev/scd0

# cd_mount is needed when addfiles is enabled.  This is where the
# rewriteable CD should be mounted in order to read files from it.
cd_mount = /mnt/cdrom1

# If this option is specified, an index file is created at the given
# location.  Otherwise, no index file is created.
# An index file is a simply a plain text file with a list of the files
# on each CD.  This helps in determining which CD a file can be located on.
# You can include %d to have the date and time be part of the file name.
index_file = /var/tmp/multicd_index_%d

# If check_config is set to 1, multicd will check to see if it has a valid
# configuration, and then exit without doing anything.
check_config = 0

# This is here because people often expect to be able to give a --help option
# on the command line.  If set, program prints a message and then exits.
help = 0
